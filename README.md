# Todo List 
Live app hosted on my website [cheok.works](https://cheok.works/todo-list/dist/index.html)
## Introduction
This todo-list web app allows one to store tasks (including their due dates and details), and categorize them into separate projects/groups. Users are also able to see these tasks as individual groups by clicking the sidebar that automatically creates tasks for the associated projects.
## Details
This project was done utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, this project uses the webpack module builder to separate the HTML, CSS and JS, while bundling the JS files.

Tasks are created utilizing the '+' button to pull up a form, in which inputs gets read in order to create and store tasks and projects.

## Features
- Fully animated
- View the short details of the todo-list tasks
- Dynamically creates tasks and custom project folders through one form
- Save the todo-list items locally through localStorage (clearing cache will remove this)
- Semi-responsive layout (note: sidebar & tasks remain same size across devices & screen sizes)

## Future features to implement
- Menu of full details of card by clicking on task rather than simple removal
- Cloud storage
- Improved styling (mobile-friendly, fully responsive layout)
- Due date notifications
